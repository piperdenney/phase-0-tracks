<h1>Space Bears</h1>
	<p><em>Most people</em> don't know that there are <strong>BEARS in SPACE</strong></p>
<h2>There are a few reasons a bear might venture to space</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>They may be hungry and searching for moon cheese</li>
		<li>They may be going to verify that Pluto is indeed a planet</li>
		<li>They may be seeking international fame</li>
	</ul>
<h2>We asked one hundred bears about their favorite space destinations, here are the top 3!</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Pluto</li>
		<li>The moon (for the cheese of course!)</li>
		<li>Neptune</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4moQf86DBsM">link</a> to a video of a bear who is lost on his way to the space airport station! He's going to miss his flight!</p>
