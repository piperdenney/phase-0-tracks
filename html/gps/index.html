What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?: I think they're helpful for organization and to create a standard way to do things, and make other people's code easier to read. I'd like to know more about how semantic tags can be helpful in making sites more accessible to people with disabilities- I feel like that in of itself is an entire area of study that is super important, and we can keep finding better ways to make information and the internet more accessible to everyone. I think they're all equally important, but header and footer are important to me as sections that people are used to going to for certain information, our brains are trained to go to either the top or sometimes side of the page for main navigation and go to the footer for things like address etc. Header and footer creates a pretty easy way to get around the site and access things in <main> parts of the page. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?: From top to bottom...left to right even, perhaps. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? I learned that I can create little shortcuts to add in a block or a tag or really whatever I want in Sublime, which is rad. I think I will definitely create more snippets at a later date, but I want to be careful not to create too many, because at this stage (and even as I grow with coding) I want to stay sharp and know how to write from scratch, or research when needed. I really want to understand and retain the material.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? I wouldn't say that the challenge was difficult for me necessarily, but I could definitely have a better understanding of certain semantic tags, like <aside>. It is helpful to look at a website and find examples of each, and I'm sure it will come with time and experience and feel more natural.
